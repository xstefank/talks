= What lurks behind the MicroProfile umbrella? -- MicroProfile standalone specifications

MicroProfile has become an industry standard for cloud-native applications. Many developers are familiar with the eight specifications that are included in the MicroProfile platform (umbrella) like Config, Health, or Fault tolerance. However, MicroProfile doesn't end up here. Several specifications are being developed in parallel to the platform specifications which just haven't got to be included in the umbrella yet. These specifications are called standalone specifications. In this session, we will talk about the five already released standalone specifications (MP Reactive Messaging/Reactive Streams Operators, MP GraphQL, MP Context Propagation, and MP LRA) and also cover what other areas of cloud computing are being investigated in the MicroProfile community.
