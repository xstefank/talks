= AI-infused command-line applications

AI models have become an integral part of our daily lives, enhancing our platforms, IDEs, and solving problems through exposed chat interfaces. However, we often rely on general-purpose models, endlessly re-explaining our use cases for repetitive tasks. What if we could simplify this process and build specialized solutions tailored to our specific requirements?

Enter Quarkus and its LangChain4j extension, which make creating AI-powered command-line applications effortless. This talk will walk you through building applications with predefined, specific saved prompts, leveraging Quarkusâ€™s lightweight Dev mode to iteratively fine-tune prompts, and finally compiling your AI-driven application into a GraalVM native executable binary with a single build-time flag. Say goodbye to repetitive explanations and create AI-infused command-line applications customized to your needs!
