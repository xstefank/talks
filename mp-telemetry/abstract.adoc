= MicroProfile Telemetry - Whatâ€™s Coming

In 2019, OpenTracing and OpenCensus projects merged into a single project called OpenTelemetry. Since then, hundreds of developers and companies have contributed to this project. In 2022, OpenTelemetry is the de facto standard defining how to collect, process, and export telemetry data in distributed applications. MicroProfile Telemetry Tracing was created to adopt this technology for easy integration with MicroProfile applications with the focus placed on the tracing aspect of OpenTelemetry. In this session, we learn how MicroProfile Telemetry Tracing instruments MicroProfile applications to participate in distributed tracing, cover how it is configured, and analyze how you can utilize OpenTelemetry API to provide even more detailed information in your traces.
