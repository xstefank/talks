= Quarkus - Supersonic Subatomic Java

Java has a generally bad name when it comes to its usage in the current fast moving world of containers, Kubernetes, microservices and serverless because of its boot times and memory footprints. However, this is no longer true with Quarkus -- a framework tailored for GraalVM and OpenJDK HotSpot which allows you to create Java applications that are ready for cloud while you can still utilize your knowledge of well known Java frameworks and standards like JAX-RS, CDI, JPA / Hibernate, Eclipse MicroProfile and much more. Come and see how your Java application can start serving client requests in a number of milliseconds while still utilizing only a few MB of RAM.
